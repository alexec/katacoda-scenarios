Let's recap:

* There are two types of input and output: **parameters** and **artifacts**.
* **parameters** are just short strings. 
* **artifacts** are simply files or directories that are compressed and uploaded to an **artifact repository** such as
  S3. 
* For one task to use the the output of another task, you can use DAG or steps templates.
