While the [recommended installation method for Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/installation/) is using the install manifests, you can also use the community-maintained argoproj Helm Charts. More information can be [found on GitHub](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm/).

In this scenario you will:

1. Install Argo Workflows into a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
2. Uninstall Argo Workflows using Helm.
3. Modify the installation so that you can access the Argo UI easily.

Normally, you will need to install [Helm](https://helm.sh/) locally to get started. We have installed it for you in this environment.
