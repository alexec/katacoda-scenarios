Let's recap:

* A workflow consists of one or more templates.
* One template is the **entrypoint** and that is the one run first.
* Some templates do **work**, such as a container templates.
* Other templates **orchestrate** that work, such as DAG templates.
* You can run task at the end of a template or workflow using an **exit handler**.
