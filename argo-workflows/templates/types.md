There are several types of templates, divided into two different categories.

The first category defines **work** to be done. This includes:

* Container
* Container Set
* Data
* Resource
* Script

The second category **orchestrate** the work:

* DAG
* Steps
* Suspend

We're going to take a deep-dive into the two most common: containers and DAG.
