There are far too many endpoints to go into detail in this lesson. You can find API docs in the user interface, try it
now:

[Open /apidocs](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-2746-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/apidocs)

You can use the API docs to send API requests, so it is really useful to testing things out.

## Exercise

Open the API docs and find an endpoint to create workflow templates. Create a workflow template and then submit it.
