## Troubleshooting

Things that could help:

* Turn your VPN off.
* Clear your browser's cache.

## Contributing

Tips:

* Katacoda can take 15m replicate changes, so it can be easier to link to assets than to embed them.
* Making a changes to `intro.md` is a good way to see you're change was replicated.
* Katacoda tends to fail without any diagnostics or remediation action. So make small changes incrementally, and be
  ready to rollback if anything weird happens.
* Starting pods in MUCH slower than running binaries.
