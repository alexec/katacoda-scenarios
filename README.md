If you find any problem - please raise an issue - or better still create a pull request to fix it.

## Contributing

Changes are propagated to Katacoda's CDN once committed to `master` branch (Katacoda does not support `main` branch). So
this means you changes must be on `master` to be seen.

I'm not sure how best to make it easy to see your changes.

Tips:

* Katacoda can take 15m replicate changes, so it can be easier to link to assets than to embed them.
* Making a changes to `intro.md` is a good way to see you're change was replicated.
* Katacoda tends to fail without any diagnostics or remediation action. So make small changes incrementally, and be
  ready to rollback if anything weird happens.
* Starting pods in MUCH slower than running binaries.
